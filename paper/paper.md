# Summary

Operational modal analysis (OMA) is an exciting and relatively new branch of 
modal testing. It allows to estimate the modal properties (natural frequencies, 
mode shapes and damping ratios) of a structure from ambient vibration tests. 
In these tests the structure is under its operating conditions (hence the name), 
the input excitation is neither known or controlled, but assumed to be 
'broadband random'. Ambient vibration tests have both practical and economical 
advantage over free vibration or forced vibration tests (with known input), 
especially for civil engineering structures (e.g., buildings, bridges).
